## 📄 Overview 
Command-line debugger for native C++ code written with modern C++ (C++ 18). Has support for x64 architectures. Works on Linux or WSL

I started this project out of my love for systems programming. Frankly, I really didn't think of a practical need for this since that wasn't the priority I had in mind. Rather, I just wanted to work on and develop my skills in something I really like.
